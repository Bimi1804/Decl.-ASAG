Tool description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tool can import and display short answer questions, pre-process the answers for 
process discovery and generate an event-log in .xes for it.
A DECLARE file (.decl) that was discovered from the exported event-log can be imported.
The discovered constraints can be rated as important or not important, and the answers 
can be graded.
To support answer grading, the tool will highlight the important constraints that an 
answer fulfills.
