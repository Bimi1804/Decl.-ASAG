		Question:  What are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
		Answer: They both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.

5	[6]	Both involve a controlled repetition structures, and they both have a termination test.  Also both of them can loop forever. 
2	[5]	As discussed earlier, recursion may be used to process iterative actions. Recursion is used for calculations where the answer can be described in a function that relates to itself.
5	[8]	Both iteration and recursion are based on control statements and involve repetition. They can both also occur indefinitely.

5	[4]	Iteration and recursion have many similarities: both are based on a control statement, involve repetition, involve a termination test, gradually approach termination and can occur infinitely.
5	[24]	Both rely on repetition, both have a base case, both can become an infinite loop. Anything recursive can also be solved with iteration.
4	[9]	Both will repeat (loop) until a condition is met, and exit the loop. Both are capable of entering an infinite loop.
3	[22]	anything you can do iterativly you can do recursively
4.5	[23]	Both are repetative and both have a end test.
3.5	[2]	Incorrectly writing either can result in infinite loops, both perform the same task over and over.

0	[12]	not answered
3	[21]	anything you can do recursively you can do iteratively
3.5	[13]	Many problems can be solved by both iteration and recursion, and either may go into a condition of infinite execution if a termination test is omitted.
5	[11]	Iteration and recursion both use repetition and perform several simple operations and algorithms successively until they reach a certain limit.  So both involve a termination test to find that limit and both slowly approach that termination limit.  Both are based on a control statement as well.  <br><br>If coded poorly, both can continue on for forever until the compiler or the computer either locks up, shuts down or halts the operation.
5	[17]	both based on control statement, involve repetition, and involve a termination test within loops
2	[7]	they are methods of repeating the same task.
5	[10]	Both involve a termination test.  <br>They use a control statement and repition to solve the problem. <br>They can also result in an infinite loop.
5	[27]	based on a control statement, involve repetition, involve a termination test.
5	[25]	Both are bases on a control statement. Both involve repetition. Both involve a termination test. Both gradually approach termination. Both can occur infinitely.
5	[20]	both based on a control statement, both involve repitition, both involve a termination test, both gradually approach termination, both can potentially occur infinetly.
5	[18]	they are both based on a control statement, both involve repetition, both involve a termination case, both graduatlly approach that termination case, and both can occur infinitely
5	[19]	They both use repetition, a control or test to terminate, and both can infinitely repeat if not defined correctly.
5	[30]	Both are based on a control statement; both gradually approach termination ending with a termination test; both involve repetition, and can both repeat infinitely if their  termination requirements are not met.
5	[16]	both are based on a control statement, involve repetition and involve a termination test. both gradually approach termination, both can occur infinitely
3.5	[26]	they are used to solve the same type of problems. they do a task over and over again until a cirtain conditional statement is reached (its called the base case in recursion).
5	[1]	Based on control statement;  involve repetition; involve a terminal test; both can occur infinitly<br>  
5	[28]	repetition, termination test, eventually terminate, occur infinately
3	[15]	both need to have some kind of base case to tell when the loop needs to stop.
3.5	[14]	they both are able to do repetiive tasks. however recurisve calls itself with different parameters and defines and exit clause that is guaranteeed to be reached. Iterative includes a loop which iterates a pre-determined number of times, or checks for an exit clause every time through
